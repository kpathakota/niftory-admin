# Org and Apps

## Overview

Your Organization is essentially the home for you and your team in Niftory. Currently, you can create one app per org in the Niftory platform.&#x20;

Your organization has a team (all your managers, creators) and an app, which gives you everything you need to create NFTs and build apps.&#x20;

## Your App

In this page, you can setup your smart contract and receive your API keys. For your smart contract, there's no coding required. We provide an automatic, robust contract for you to get started with immediately.&#x20;

Questions about the API keys? See our [API Guide](https://docs.niftory.com/docs/core-concepts/authentication/getting-your-api-keys#keys-and-secrets).

## Your Team

This step is very easy - to add a new member, simply provide their name, email and role. Right now, users can only be added with the Creator Role.
