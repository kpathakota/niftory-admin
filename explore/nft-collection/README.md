In your **Collections** view, you'll see all of your NFTs and Content.&#x20;

* **Sets** are primarily a way to organize your NFT Collection. These **Sets** are created and minted directly on the blockchain.&#x20;
* **Collectibles** are essentially templates for all of the NFTs that are being made. These **Collectibles** are created and minted on the blockchain.&#x20;
* **NFTs** are the final items that are created, minted and transfer to users accounts and wallets.&#x20;
