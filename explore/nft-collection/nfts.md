# NFTs

**NFTs** are what all of your users are looking to get, whether its from a Marketplace, a Loyalty program, or a game - they're the key asset that goes into your users wallets. Each NFT is minted based on a **Collectible** and has it's own unique serial number to differentiate it from other NFTs based on the same **Collectible**.
